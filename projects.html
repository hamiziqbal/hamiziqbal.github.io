    <h6> My project is a Unity Horror Game that is compatible with VR. It follows the player going around a dark forest in search of 8 pages. After each page is collected, the monster will get faster. Once you collect the 8 pages, you will win. If the monster gets to you, you will die and restart the game. Good luck!</h6>

    <h6> The monster that chases you. Doesn't have animations because unity is really weird with that.</h6>
